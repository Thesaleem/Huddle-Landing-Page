## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I made a whole landing page with CSS, learnt to use the root element to define my colours, font size, wight and family. I also changed the logo colour of the company using CSS.

```css
.footer-logo{
    filter:  brightness(0) invert(1);
}
```

### Continued development

Still need to learn how to align my flex items in a way that matches similar flex items
